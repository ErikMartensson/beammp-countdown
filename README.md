# BeamMP Simple Countdown
Just a simple countdown that can be triggered either through chat or server console. All player vehicles will be frozen during countdown and unfrozen at "GO!". A countdown sound effect will be heard as well.

By default will count down from 5 seconds
```
/cd
```

You can also specify the number of seconds to count from with `/cd <number>`
```
/cd 10
```
> When running the command like this, the number of seconds will be saved so that you just need to type `/cd` the next time.
